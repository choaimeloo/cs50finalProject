# cs50finalProject
basic journaling app called "penser for cs50" with popup Chrome extension & using CSS Flexbox for homepage layout

All files required are saved in these four folders: final files, penser popup, static & templates. ("project.zip" also contains all these files.) Everything else saved in this repository are versions of these files.

"final files" contains the python code & sql database.
"static" contains the css & the emoji image png file.
"templates" contains all html files.
"penser popup" contains the files required to make the chrome extension popup.
